# 🎬 AI-Powered Video Scene & Emotion Analysis  

## 📌 Overview  
This project was developed during my internship at **Visatsy** in collaboration with the **École Polytechnique de Tunisie**.  
It focuses on building an **AI-powered video analysis system** that performs **scene segmentation, visual understanding, and emotion recognition**.  
The final goal is to enable intelligent **video recommendation, mental health analysis, and advanced emotion-aware retrieval systems**.

## 🚀 Objectives  
- Segment videos into **meaningful scenes** using shot boundary detection.  
- Extract **keyframes** that best represent each scene.  
- Detect **objects, faces, and gestures** using state-of-the-art models.  
- Perform **emotion recognition** via facial expressions and heuristic cues.  
- Generate **descriptive captions** for each scene using multimodal models.  
- Store embeddings for **semantic search & retrieval** (RAG-based).  
- Provide an intuitive **dashboard/UI** for visualization and interaction.

## 🔧 Use Cases  
1. **🎥 Recommendation Systems** – Suggest videos or clips based on detected themes, moods, or objects.  
2. **🧠 Mental Health Analysis** – Identify emotional states (stress, depression, anxiety, etc.) from video interactions.  
3. **😊 Emotion Analysis** – Track characters’ emotional evolution across a film, series, or recorded session.
